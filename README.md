**Data Structures and Algorithms**  

This repository provides an introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms, focusing on implementation, analysis, and evaluation. Topics include stacks, queues, lists, search trees, hash tables, sorting algorithms, object-oriented programming, and efficiency analysis. The goal is to develop elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems through both theoretical and experimental approaches.
